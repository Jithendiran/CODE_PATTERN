## SOLID
* [Single Responsibility](./SingleResponsibility.cpp)
    - A class should only have one reason to change
    - Seperation of concern - different classes handling different independent tasks

* [Open Closed](./OpenClosed.cpp)
    - Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification

* [Liskov Substitution](./LiskovSubstitution.cpp)
    - Basetype should be able to substitute for a subtype

* [Interface Segregation](./InterfaceSegregation.cpp)
    - Split the interface into smaller chunks

* [Dependency Inversion](./DependencyInversion.cpp)
    - This is different from dependecy injection
    - High level modules should not depend on low level; use abstractions
